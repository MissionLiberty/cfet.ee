“Mission: Liberty” is a _first-principles-driven organization_ for active people spreading the message of liberty.

The first principles that bind us together are:

* Misesian praxeology,
* Rothbardian/[Hoppean propertarianism](https://wiki.mises.org/wiki/The_Economics_and_Ethics_of_Private_Property),
* and Randian Objectivism Ethics.

The history of the organization dates back to [Mises Estonia](https://mises.ee/), with first events happening
in 2016. In 2021, members of the group decided to continue as "Mission: Liberty," hosting various events, making friends
around the world and planning activities for the future.

The best way to join us is to join the [meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/tallinn-libertarian-meetup/) or send an
email to [us](mailto:info@missionliberty.ee).
