In this Open Forum session, we welcomed Justin Witt, an undergraduate political science student from the University of
Notre Dame (USA) who is writing his research thesis on the attitudes of Estonians towards free market economy
reforms. The research aims at testing hypotheses concerning the relationship between free market attitudes and economic
growth after reforms, nostalgia from previous centrally planned economic systems, and Western political culture.

This meeting was an exciting exploration of Estonian political and economic culture, driven by Justinâ€™s theoretical
studies and practical application to a workshop-style session whereby all attendees are kindly invited to participate
with their experiences, views and opinions. We want to help Justin to write his research thesis while we improve our
understanding of Estonian culture. All EBS students will benefit from observing and connecting with a fellow American
student working on his graduation paper. Further, we wish to develop our friendship and academic connections with such
prestigious academic institutions in the USA.
