The Free Market Road Show, the premiere European travelling conference uniting scholars and free thinkers of all ages and professions around the topics of liberty, prosperity and peace, makes its annual stop at Tallinn on April 10th. The Centre for Free Economic Thought at Estonian Business School is the local partner of the Austrian Economics Centre and the Hayek Institute in Vienna. The Hayek Institute just celebrated the 30th anniversary of its foundation.

This time, we are honoured to be visited by two top Hayek scholars and an expert on EU politics to discuss the ongoing relevance of F A Hayek and Milton Friedman's ideas about liberty in the context of current European politics and the upcoming elections to the European Parliament.

In our complex world, the knowledge distributed among individuals is immense and interrelated at great distances. This knowledge cannot be accumulated and inserted into the decisions of central planners. Modern examples of emerging spontaneous orders, such as social networks and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Bitcoin), confirm the prescience and validity of Hayek's theories regarding evolutionary institutions, spontaneous order, and the competition of free currencies that the panellists will discuss. Personal choice, entrepreneurship, and competitiveness have taken a hit due to the European Commission and Parliament's fondness for control, big government, and dirigiste industrial policy. The upcoming European elections are an urgent signal to think deeply about the lessons from philosophy and history with the sights set on our future prosperity together as Europeans.

Join us in learning, thinking, and discussing these fascinating and urgent topics, followed by free discussions and refreshments. The event is free and open to all EBS people and the general public, so please bring your critical-thinking friends. Please RSVP here by April 8th so that we can make the arrangements. Welcome!
