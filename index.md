title: The Centre for Free Economic thought
---

The Centre for Free Economic Thought is the Estonian Business Schoolâ€™s think tank devoted to the study of free markets in the classical liberal and Austrian Economics traditions.

The Estonian Business School has a strong focus on entrepreneurship in a digital world, and therefore the Centre focuses on the theoretical and practical approaches to the creation of value and the wealth of nations through entrepreneurship and innovation.

Additionally, we cannot forget our history, as Estonia suffered the ravages of socialism for so many years, to later choose liberalism and finally develop into a leading entrepreneurial and digital society. On year 2021 we remember and celebrate the 30th anniversary of the independence of Estonia from the socialist Soviet Union.

At the Centre for Free Economic Thought we endeavour to foster a free society of free individuals through education and open discussion of ideas.
